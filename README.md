Make sure you dont forget to change the QUEUE_CONNECTION in the env.

I didnt seed a lot of users since I don't think it would really be
 any difference this there would be no way to really check
 if the emails got to the receiver. 
 
 I will add myself in there just so its not empty, and real emails
  would be ones that have agrees_to_newsletter as true, so when you add yours (manually)
   make sure you have that checked.
